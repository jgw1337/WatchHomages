# WatchHomages

Watch faces inspired by Citizen's Star Wars line.

Since Apple Watch does not yet support custom watch faces, these watch faces are simply apps that can run on iPhones and Apple Watches.


## Watch Faces

### Han Solo

The distinct ticks of the quartz movement highlights the "piece of junk" nature of the Millennium Falcon.

### Luke Skywalker

The smooth motion of the mechanical movement embodies the fluid grace of the Jedi.

### Boba Fett

The quartz movement synchronizes with Boba Fett's digital readout.
